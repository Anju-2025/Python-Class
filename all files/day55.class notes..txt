autoincrement:

autoincrement field will increment the id from 1.
if we insert first as id=100,then from next autoincrement from 101.

insert into students1 values(100,"fathima","kannur");     -- to_start_with_100
insert into students1(name,place)values("anu","ktym"),("ammu","kochi"),("keerthi","tvm"),("rahul","idk");
select * from students1;
truncate table students1;        -- differencebtw_delete&truncate
delete from students1;

input : ammu
output : Ammu
step by step answer : 
select substring(name,1,1)from students1;
select upper(substring(name,1,1))from students1;
select substring(name,2)from students1;
select lower(substring(name,2))from students1;
select concat(upper(substring(name,1,1)),lower(substring(name,2)))as name from students1;
select * from students1;

-- between(include both start and end value)

select * from students1 where id between 3 and 5;
select * from students1 where name between "a%" and "g%";
-- notbetween
select * from students1 where id  not between 3 and 5;
select * from students1 where name not between "a%" and "g%";
-- in
select * from students1 where name in ('anu',"rahul","keerthi");

-- notin
select * from students1 where name not in ('anu',"rahul","keerthi");

-- subquery
select name from students1 where id =(select max(id)from students1);
select max(id)from students1;

-- exists

select * from students1 where exists (select * from student where id=2);
